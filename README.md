# Learning Javascript with Data Structures and Algorithms

## Javascript

Javascript is a lightweight interpreted <span style="color:`#D81F26`;" title="Just-in-time (JIT) compilation is a computing technique where code is compiled during program execution,commonly translating bytecode to machine code for direct execution. JIT compilers continuously analyze executing code to determine when compilation or recompilation would provide a speed advantage. JIT compilation blends the speed of compiled code with the flexibility of interpretation, though it incurs interpreter and compilation overhead. It's well-suited for dynamic programming languages, supporting late-bound data types and security guarantees, and enables adaptive optimizations like dynamic recompilation and microarchitecture-specific speedups.">(JIT Compiled)</span>
